Writing code can be great fun, but dealing with the 0-0.1 portion of the development pipeline (the part where you have to structure your project and do the pathings) can be meh. This repository provides a tasteful and functional boilerplate for python projects, so you can focus on the fun stuff. 

Clone and get to the interesting work!


## Installation
- for development: editably install ala- `pip install -e .[dev]` (see pyproject.toml for dependencies)
